Implementation strategy:
    (describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.)
    We sat together and went over all the instructions/specifications. We together tried to figure out
    ways to implement all the methods by sketching all steps out. And we took turn writing out the actual
    code while the other observing and gave suggestions.
Testing strategy:
    (how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?)
    We first added test cases using black box testing strategy, by only looking at the spec we interpreted what
    should we expect as the outcome of our later implementation. After implementing methods, we then write more
    test cases according to the way we implement. We then run the test coverage to see if we have covered all lines
    and went back to add more if needed.
Known problems:
    (are there any things that do not work?)

Comments on the assignment: It's challenging at first to understand what we were supposed to achieve, but it's
gradually getting better as moving on.
